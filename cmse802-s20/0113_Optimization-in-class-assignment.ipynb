    "\n",
    "One of the goals of this course is to teach you how to leverage the power of examples found on the Internet.  Often students, new to programming, see an code example they do not understand and immediately shut it own. Experienced programmers have learned that example code, even when not understood is a great way to learn something new.  The trick is to get comfortable playing with the code.  Here are some basic steps to try:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Copy and paste the code into a Jupyter notebook to see if you can get it working.  SOme common things to keep an eye out for include:\n",
    "    - **Python 2** examples (Keep an eye out for print statements without parentheses). These mostly easy to fix (add parentheses)\n",
    "    - **Code that uses plotting libraries** such as ```matplotlib```.  Make sure you use the ```@matplotlib inline``` option.  \n",
    "    - **Use of extermal libraries**. Although the Anaconda python distribution has a lot of libraries already included many example require some sort of ```pip``` or ```conda``` installation.  We will cover tricks for doing this in detail in class. Two easy ones are using local directory installs (ex packages) or better yet, using python virtual environments (conda environments). \n",
    "* Read and Google any debugging messages.  Always remember the three steps to debugging:\n",
    "    1. Find **WHERE** the bug is occurring.\n",
    "    2. Identify **WHAT** is causing the bug.\n",
    "    3. Figure out **HOW** to it.  \n",
    "* Once you get something running, then it is time to modify and change it to suite your needs. "
