Write the report so someone outside of the course could make sense of how Optimization methods can be used in your area of research. "

I would love it if one of you got board and figured out how to cite references and build a bibliography inside notebooks.  Something like [cite2c](https://github.com/takluyver/cite2c) looks like it would be really cool but I haven't tried it."
